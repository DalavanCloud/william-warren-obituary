<h1>OBITUARY. WILLIAM WARREN, M.A. Died October 18, 1914, Aged 75</h1>

<p>FOR a number of years W. Warren had suifered from an internal complaint, 
which was now and again intensely painful, and compelled him at times 
to take a rest for a few days. But in spite of this intermittent illness he was 
wonderfully well, and, considering his advanced age, one could but admire the 
energy with which he still devoted himself to his work. Early in October last 
the trouble became acute, and after a week's struggle Warren had to give in and 
remain at home. During the intervals between the attacks of pain he was as 
cheerful as usual, and we all expected a speedy recovery. The doctor proposed 
an operation, which might bring relief, but at first the patient would not hear of it. 
However, when passing the house on Saturday, 17th, at noon, I saw Warren standing 
dressed at the open window of his room, and we talked together for some time 
about his illness and his affairs. He told me that he was going to the infirmary 
at Hemel Hempstead, where, if it was thought necessary, he would undergo an 
operation. He appeared pale, but was otherwise much the same as usual. Next 
morning a telegram from the infirmary announced his death. He had fainted in 
an attack of pain, and passed away without recovering consciousness. </p>

<p>William Warren was born January 20, 1839, as the eldest son of the late 
Wm. AVarreu, J. P., of Cambridge. He was educated at Oakham School, which 
he left in 1857, entering the University of Cambridge in 1808. He took a great 
interest in cricket and boating, being a very good bowler and rowing in the Lady 
Somerset boat. But the pursuit of sport did not collide with his studies. He was 
a scholar, prizeman, and exhibitioner at St. John's College, and in 1861 took first- 
class honours in classics. Choosing the scholastic career as his vocation, Warren, 
on leaving the University, accepted an appointment as master at Sedbergh School, 
becoming subsequently tutor to the present Lord Shuttleworth. From 1860 to 1877 
he was second master at Doncaster Grammar School, and in 1880 went as master 
to Stubbiugtou House School for army and navy cadets at Fareham, his application 
for a headmastership at some other school being unsuccessful. </p>

<p>The testimonials given to Warren — and which are before me — speak in very 
favourable terms of him as a teacher ; private reasons, however, compelled him to 
give up the scholastic profession about 1882, since when he has devoted his time to 
his favourite pursuit of entomology. </p>

<p>A very keen and competent collector and an untiring walker, Warren was 
indefatigable in the field. He was the first to draw attention to the entomological 
treasures of the Feus, and his earlier publications consisted of notes on his discoveries 
in that district. The Microlepidoptera were his chief subject of study, and although 
he was iu later years obliged to work almost exclusively at other groups of </p>

KOVITATES ZOOLOGICAE XXII. lOlo. l6l 

<p>Lepidoptera, he preserved to bis last days a tender love for the smallest of 
moths.</p> 

<p>When he had relinquished his career as a schoolmaster, he remained without 
a regular salaried emploj-meut, living on the rather considerable fortune left him 
by his father. The inheritance, hovcever, soon dwindled awa}', and the means of 
subsistence became more and more precarious. But his outlook on life was opti- 
mistic, and the frequent embarrassments in which he found himself up to the last 
five or si,\ years of his life could not daunt his spirits ; they were forgotten as soon 
as circumstances appeared to assume a brighter aspect. He was separated from his 
wife, but remained in communication with his only sou to the end.</p> 

<p>In 1888 Warren began work at the British Museum as an outside assistant, 
being engaged to arrange the Pyrals and Geometers. He i)ublished some papers 
on the former family in 1890, 1891, and 1892 ; but nearly all the names that he 
gave to the numerous new species of Geometridae contained in the British Museum 
collection remained unpublished for the time. Through the kind intermediation 
of Dr. Giinther, Warren oflered his services to Mr. Rothschild, and in 1892 came 
to Tring in order to name and arrange the Geometridae and a few other families, 
such as the Drepanulidae, Thyrididae, and Uraniidae. He lived at Tring for 
a couple of years, but subsequently removed to London. Although his principal 
work consisted in the naming of specimens in the Tring Museum and in describing 
the new genera and species found among our material, Warren was at liberty 
to assist other entomologists with his rapidly increasing knowledge of the families 
at which he was working, and many of the new exotic species published by others 
during the last twenty years had previously been submitted to him. </p>

<p>When Dr. Seitz asked me if I knew of some one who could undertake to 
describe the Koctuidae for his work, Die Grosssckmettei-linge der Erde, I mentioned 
Warren, who at that time was living in London and had very little to do. The 
Geometridae having already been assigned by Dr. Seitz to a very competent 
specialist, Warren agreed to come to Tring and devote himself to the Noctuids, 
and from that time until his death he was happy in having continuous employment 
without being strictly bound to official hours. </p>

<p>The number of new species and genera published by Warren is very large, 
and he will remain known to posterity as the chief specialist in Geometridae 
of the last two decades. He was assisted in his work by a catalogue he had 
compiled, containing a description of each species and variety, and, if a specimen 
had been accessible to him, a carefully executed pencil-drawing. This enormous 
work, amounting to several cubic feet of manuscript, cannot be published for 
various reasons, but it will nevertheless remain accessible at the Tring Museum. 
Some manuscripts on British Microlepidoptera were also found among Warren's 
papers, but are antiquated by more recent discoveries, and must unfortunately remain 
unpublished. Several small manuscripts on new species were ready for publication, 
while some others require arranging and revising before they can go to press.</p> 

<p>Although Warren was essentially an entomologist of the older school, he 
paid more careful attention to the structure of the wings, antennae, and legs, 
as far as these organs can be studied with an ordinary lens, than did (and do) 
some of his contemporaries, and for this reason his work will be more highly 
appreciated by the specialist than by the general collector. — K. Jordan. </p>
